| Requirement ID | Description               | User Story                                                                                                              | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR001          | Creating a New Task       | As a user, I want to be able to create a new focused task with a specific duration so I can start a work session.       | The system should provide a form for entering task description and selecting duration. Upon submission, the task should become active and the timer should start. |
| FR002          | Starting Task Timer       | As a user, I want the timer to automatically start when I create a new task so I can begin working immediately.         | The system should initiate a countdown timer with visual progress indication as soon as a task is created.                                                        |
| FR003          | Viewing Active Task       | As a user, I want to clearly see my current active task and remaining time so I can stay focused on my work.            | The system should prominently display the active task description and a visual timer with time remaining.                                                         |
| FR004          | Completing Tasks          | As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as completed when finished, either automatically or manually.               | The system should automatically complete tasks when the timer ends, and provide a button to complete tasks early if needed.                                       |
| FR005          | Viewing Task History      | As a user, I want to see all my completed tasks with their details so I can track my productivity over time.            | The system should display a chronological list of completed tasks with their descriptions, durations, and completion times.                                       |
| FR006          | Clearing Task History     | As a user, I want to be able to clear my completed tasks history when I want to start fresh.                            | The system should provide a clear mechanism to remove all completed tasks from the history.                                                                       |
| FR007          | Persistent Task Storage   | As a user, I want my active and completed tasks to be saved between browser sessions so I don't lose my progress.       | The system should automatically save all task data to localStorage and restore it when the application loads.                                                     |
| FR008          | Visual Progress Indicator | As a user, I want to see a visual representation of my progress during a task session so I can gauge my remaining time. | The system should display a circular progress bar that visually represents the percentage of time completed.                                                      |
| FR009          | Responsive Design         | As a user, I want to use the application on different device sizes so I can focus anywhere.                             | The system should provide an optimal experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with appropriate responsive layouts.                                       |
| FR010          | Minimalist Interface      | As a user, I want a clean, distraction-free interface so I can maintain focus on my task.                               | The system should present a simple, uncluttered UI with minimal elements and calming colors.                                                                      |
| FR011          | Task Duration Selection   | As a user, I want to choose different durations for my tasks so I can match my work to my focus capacity.               | The system should provide options for common work session durations (e.g., 25, 45, 90 minutes).                                                                   |
| FR012          | Early Completion Option   | As a user, I want to be able to complete a task before the timer ends if I finish early.                                | The system should provide a clear button to end the current task session prematurely while still recording it as completed.                                       |
